Wombat2 is a general purpose language with a bottom-up approach to program correctness. In other words, we start with an axiomatic treatment of the language types and the target machine, and then prove the correctness of library functions, including operators.

It also comes with a simplified syntax system (includes user-defined operators), and a subtyping system designed to rival the convenience of dynamic typing.

And given my age it is unlikely to be finished, unless others get interested.

The first step will be the syntax system, an improvement on the one in [https://github.com/rks987/marsupial](https://github.com/rks987/marsupial).
